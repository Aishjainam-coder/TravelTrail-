## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **API Choice**: Selected Amadeus API for both flights and hotels (free tier)
2. **Architecture**: FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend
3. **Performance**: Implemented token caching and reduced timeouts
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic mock data fallback when API fails
5. **Code Organization**: Merged related functions into single files
6. **UI Design**: Tabbed interface for better user experience

## Lessons Learned

- Token caching significantly improves API response times
- Mock data fallback is essential for reliable demo
- Single API key can serve multiple endpoints
- Error handling improves user experience
- Code consolidation reduces maintenance overhead

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sophisticated ranking algorithms
- Implement user preferences and loyalty programs
- Add booking functionality
- Expand to more travel APIs
- Add mobile-responsive design
